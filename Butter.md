Salted vs Unsalted Butter
=========================

The main recipe calls for salted butter, but if you don't have that or want more
control over the amount of salt, you can substitute unsalted butter and add the
salt yourself. How much to add is going to depend on what kind of salt you have.

Here's what's worked for me, just be aware you may need to adjust this for your
brand of salt. Quantities are in tsp because I don't have a scale sensitive
enough to go by weight.

| Type                 | Single Batch | Double Batch | Triple Batch |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Table salt (Costco)  | 1/4 tsp      | 1/2 tsp      | 3/4 tsp      |
| Kosher Salt (Morton) | 1/2 tsp      | 1 tsp        | 1 1/2 tsp    |
